-- events.tentative_created_at/tentative_created_by (added in 00040 alongside
-- is_tentative itself) were never added to events_safe's explicit column
-- list, so ContractList.jsx has had no way to show when a tentative booking
-- was actually created. Recreating with the two columns added; everything
-- else copied from the view's current definition (00094) unchanged.
